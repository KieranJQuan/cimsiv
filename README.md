Hello, you've found this project.
This is similar to Conway's Game of Life except it has multiple layers for different types of organisms. There are a bunch of interesting interactions to discover and a bunch of weird ones.
Find out by investigating these cellular automata. (Is it multiple cellular automata or just one automaton if they're layered?)
