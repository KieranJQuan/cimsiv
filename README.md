Hello, you've found this project.
This is similar to Conway's Game of Life except it has multiple layers for different types of organisms. There are a bunch of interesting interactions to discover and a bunch of weird ones.
Regardless, each organism is different in these cellular automata. (Is it a plural 2D cellular automata or actually a singular 3D automaton? Who knows?)
